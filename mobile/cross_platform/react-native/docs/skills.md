# Yaşayan Ayetler – Skills & Principles

## Product Identity
Yaşayan Ayetler is a spiritual reflection app focused on
**living Qur’anic verses in daily life**.

It is not a religious authority.
It is not a productivity tool.
It is not a social media platform.

It is a quiet companion.

## Core Skills of the System

### 1. Reflection, Not Instruction
- The system never explains Qur’anic verses.
- It facilitates self-reflection.
- It preserves the original wording and dignity of the verses.

---

### 2. Gentle Personalization
- Users never choose verses directly.
- The system assigns verses through guided randomness.
- Personalization is based on intention, not preference.

---

### 3. Emotional Safety
- Struggle is allowed.
- Silence is allowed.
- Failure is not recorded as a negative state.

---

### 4. Ethical AI Usage
- AI never acts as a religious authority.
- AI does not give advice framed as obligation.
- AI avoids moral comparison.

---

### 5. Anti-Gamification
- No points
- No streaks
- No levels
- No achievements

Consistency is encouraged through meaning, not reward.

---

### 6. Minimalist Design Thinking
- Less features, more depth
- White space is intentional
- Typography is treated as part of the spiritual experience

---

### 7. Community Without Display
- Sharing is anonymous and optional.
- No likes, no follower counts.
- Content is shown as lived experience, not achievement.

## North Star Principle

> If it makes faith measurable,
> it does not belong here.

## Final Note

Yaşayan Ayetler is built on the belief that:

> Qur’an lives in people,
> not in dashboards.
